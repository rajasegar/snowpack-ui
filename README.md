# Snowpack-ui

Run & Manage [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev) projects from the browser instead of the terminal. 


## Installation

```
npm i -g snowpack-ui
```

```
npx snowpack-ui
```


## Usage

```
snowpack-ui
```

If you are starting from an empty directory, it will ask you to create a new snowpack project, which in turn requires [create-snowpack-app](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/master/create-snowpack-app), 
otherwise you can run tasks and manage an existing Snowpack project.


## Things to do
- Save app templates as default
- Manage Snowpack config
- More extended dependency info ( things like outdated packages etc.,)
- Option to install project dependencies (first time)


## Inspiration
This project is greatly inspired by the [vue-cli-ui]() and most of the code is taken from [ember-cli-ui](https://github.com/rajasegar/ember-cli-ui).
